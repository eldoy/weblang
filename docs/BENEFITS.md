### 🚀 Benefits of Weblang

* **🧠 AI-Native**
  Structured for large language models — easy to generate, modify, and validate automatically.

* **📦 Function-as-Data**
  Send entire executable logic blocks to APIs or servers. Clients define behavior, not just parameters.

* **💻 Command Line Friendly**
  Run Weblang scripts directly in the terminal. Ideal for automation, scripting, and glue code without external tools.

* **🔄 Transform Anything**
  Acts as a universal data transformer — read CSV, filter JSON, format HTML, stream logs — all declaratively.

* **📏 Minimal & Compact**
  Clean, YAML-style syntax with consistent patterns. Compact enough to embed anywhere.

* **🌍 Platform- & Language-Agnostic**
  The engine spec is portable — implement it in Rust, Go, Zig, Deno, etc. Logic stays the same everywhere.

* **⚡️ Potentially Faster Than JS**
  With compiled engines (Rust/Zig), Weblang can beat JavaScript for logic execution.

* **🛠 Fully Extensible**
  Everything is a function — even `if`, `return`, and `validate`. Override or extend core logic safely.

* **🔐 Safe by Design**
  No Turing-completeness by default. Execution is sandboxed, declarative, and permission-based.

* **💡 Clear Execution Model**
  Top-down, pure data flow. Deterministic. Easy to trace, debug, and reason about.

* **🎨 Distinct & Recognizable**
  Unique syntax (`=var`, `@func`, `$var`) makes Weblang immediately identifiable and easy to parse.

* **🌐 Web-First, Server-Ready**
  Built for API requests, background jobs, cloud functions, or custom user flows.

**Weblang is the logic layer for modern infrastructure** — programmable, declarative, embeddable, and future-facing.
